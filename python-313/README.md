# Python 3.13 Demos

This repository contains sample code and data files that demos some of the new features in Python 3.13.

## Introduction

You need Python 3.13 installed to run these examples. See the following tutorial instructions:

- [How Can You Install a Pre-Release Version of Python](https://realpython.com/python-pre-release/)

Note that for testing the free-threading and JIT features, you'll need to build Python from source code with additional compiler flags enabled, as [explained in the tutorial](https://realpython.com/python313-free-threading-jit/#get-your-hands-on-the-new-features). Alternatively, you can run benchmarks using Docker containers as [explained below](#free-threading-and-jit).

You can learn more about Python 3.13's new features in the following Real Python tutorials:

<!-- - [Python 3.13: Cool New Features for You to Try](https://realpython.com/python313-new-features/) -->
- [Python 3.13 Preview: Free Threading and a JIT Compiler](https://realpython.com/python313-free-threading-jit/) 
- [Python 3.13 Preview: A Modern REPL](https://realpython.com/python313-repl)

You'll find examples from these tutorials in this repository.

## Examples

This section only contains brief instructions on how you can run the examples. See the tutorials for technical details.

### REPL



### Free-Threading and JIT

You need to enable a few build options to try out the free-threading and JIT features in Python 3.13. You can find more information in the dedicated [README file](free-threading-jit/README.md).
