# Speed Up Your Python Program With Concurrency

Corresponding code to the Real Python tutorial, [Speed up your Python Program with Concurrency](https://realpython.com/python-concurrency/).

First, create and activate a [virtual environment](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/) to use this code. Then, install the required libraries into it:

```sh
$ python -m venv venv/
$ source venv/bin/activate
(venv) $ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will ensure you have the required Python packages.
